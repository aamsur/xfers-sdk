# Web SDK Usage Overview

## Prerequisites

### 1. Xfers User Access Token

The Xfers user acccess token is a token that is required to initialize our SDK. The SDK relies on this token to communicate with the Xfers backend. 

**Xfers connect** is backend process in which you can obtain an Xfers user access token. If you have not gone through the process in setting up **Xfers Connect**, please refer to the **Backend Integration** guide over [here](https://github.com/Xfers/xfers-sdk/wiki/Backend-requirements-for-SDK)

## Download and installation of the Xfers Web SDK

Once the setup for **Xfers User Access Token** is complete, proceed to download Xfers Web SDK either through our **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** or **via a npm install**


### 1. Through CDN & <script> Tag

Add the following lines into the corresponding HTML file's `<head></head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous">

<!-- The following files can also be downloaded from the js folder in this repository -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Xfers/xfers-sdk@2b10a00db2cb7d7f1c16705c9c424ab7dfa0b1cc/JavaScript/dist/vendors~xfers.bundle.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Xfers/xfers-sdk@2b10a00db2cb7d7f1c16705c9c424ab7dfa0b1cc/JavaScript/dist/xfers.bundle.js"></script>
```

Note that the Xfers Web SDK requires a mounting point on a HTML DOM. Add the following line into the same HTML file `<body></body>` section:

```html
<!-- The ID of the DOM element is to be used to instantiate Web SDK later -->
<!-- Make sure the following line is executed before the instantiation in the next segment -->
<div id="xfers_elements"></div>
```

Next step, initialize the components by adding the following javascript into the same `<body></body>` section. This is required on all the pages that uses the Xfers SDK 

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  
  // Paste your own Xfers User Access Token here
  const accessToken = 'insert the xfers user access token here upon retrieving it from your server backend'  
  
  /* Instantiation takes in two parameters:
   * 1st param => mountingElementId: 'xfers_elements'
   * 2nd param => accessToken: e.g. - 'YTB7iKVauTzJ8zyk6cJ4ooTOUGJMG-SYDPxFNFTDs4Z'
   */
  const xfers = new Xfers("xfers_elements", accessToken);
  
</script>
```

Next step, trigger the SDK flows by executing the following command:

```javascript
const paymentFlowParam = { amount: 3000, currency: 'SGD', orderId: 'AZ03283' }
xfers.startPaymentFlow(paymentFlowParam);
```

### 2. Through npm, import/export (Coming Soon)

Install the package through npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @xfers/xfers-js-sdk
```

Then import the Xfers UI Elements into your code:
```javascript
import { Xfers } from '@xfers/xfers-js-sdk'
```

## Flows Available & Documentations

### Verification
* startVerificationFlow (Coming Soon)

### Transaction
#### 1. startPaymentFlow(paymentParamsObject)
```javascript
@param {String} amount - [REQUIRED] The charge amount imposed on user.
@param {String} currency - [REQUIRED]The currency applied onto the charge amount.
@param {String} orderId - [REQUIRED] Unique ref no provided by you to prevent double charging, this cannot be repeated

// Example:
const paymentParamsObject = {
  amount: '3000',
  currency: 'SGD',
  orderId: 'AZ30183'
}
```
Payment Flow allows merchant to create a charge on users' Xfers Wallets.

- If there is enough balance, the flow will deduct the fund from users' Xfers Wallets automatically and move it to Merchants' Xfers Wallets.
- If there isn't enough balance, the flow will guide users on how to top-up Xfers Wallets.
- It will also check if transacting users are KYC-verified, if verification is required, it will guide the users to go through Verification process.
